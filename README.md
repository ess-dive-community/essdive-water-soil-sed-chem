# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Water-Soil-Sediment Chemistry Data v 1.0.0

## About the reporting format
This reporting format is recommended for data from chemical concentration measurements of water, soil, and sediment samples.

## Quickstart Guide
  1. **Read** the instructions for each file type in this reporting format: main instructions, terminology, methods, data, data dictionary
  2. **Review** examples of filled in template files
  3. **Download** blank templates
  4. **Use term list** to fill in templates
  5. **Save** all templates as CSV files and **upload to ESS-DIVE** as dataset
    
    
## How to contribute

This reporting format is evolving and adapting to meet the needs of the community. Feedback and new contributions are welcome. If you would like to suggest a change, please submit a GitHub issue using one of the [templates we provide](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-water-soil-sed-chem/issues/new/choose).

Though our intent is to provide a reporting format that will enable data producers to gain wider recognition for their data and data users to gain more streamlined options for automated download and synthesis of datasets, the result is a reporting format that will not fully please anyone and that leaves a lot to be desired from everybody. 

If you have any questions about this reporting format, you can also email ESS-DIVE support at ess-dive-support *at* lbl.gov.

## References

Our reporting format was loosely based on those used by the EPA and USGS through the [Water Quality Portal (WQP)](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/), but were also inspired from other standards, best practices, and recommendations within the water quality, soil science, and geological survey communities. Most importantly the reporting format and templates were developed to fit with needs, recommendations, and advice from the DOE-BER-ESS community including both data producers and data users â€“ a summary of the community member feedback and list of consulted members can be found as part of the dataset cited above.
