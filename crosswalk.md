## Introduction to the crosswalk
The [crosswalk](#the-crosswalk) shows how this reporting format (listed in the table below under the ESS-DIVE column) maps onto other data reporting formats/standards when elements are common across data reporting formats. In the section below, we describe each of the data reporting formats included in the crosswalk.   

### ESS-DIVE
Sample metadata is registered separately (according to the sample metadata reporting format) and linked via a globally unique sample identifier. One column per variable, multiple header rows for most relevant metadata, methods infomation in separate file, terminology file is used for defining codes and translating between used terms and recommended vocabularies/reporting format terminology. 

### WQX (USGS/EPA)
Project metadata and monitoring locations are reported separately and connected with samples and analytical data by ID. Concentration data and analysis metadata are reported in the same table (separate columns for all metadata). Each variable is reported on a separate row (i.e. if several variables are reported for the same sample there will be multiple rows for that sample). 

### ODM2
Database with separate tables for e.g. projects, methods, sampling features, results etc. Closest comparison with the ESS-DIVE reporting format for water/soil/sediment chemistry (meta)data is found in the ODM2core. However, there are additional tables that are used for recording metadata for e.g. equipment (instruments etc), data quality specifications, detailed methodology etc.  

### NEON  
Pre-designed (i.e. prior to project launch) methodological and reporting formats and standards. Methodology and terminology is largely controlled and found in the online document library. Data is reported with one column per variable (fieldName) and one row per sample. Term descriptions, data types, and units are reported in a separate file.

### MIxS
The genomic standards consortium (GSC) family of minimum information standards (checklists) â€“ Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS). Separate checklists for water, sediment, and soil, but structure is the same. Used by EMSL. 

### EarthChem
EarthChem operates a suite of data systems that assist Geoscientists with accessing, sharing, and using geochemical, petrological, and geochronological data. EarthChem was established in 2005 and has been a part of the NSF-funded IEDA Data Facility since 2010. The information included here refers to Soil Sample Data and Metadata. Some metadata is included in data file as columns before the parameter (i.e. analyzed variables) columns. Each parameter column has 3 header rows: Parameter, Method Code, and Unit. Samples are listed in rows. Analytical metadata and method-specific metadata are reported in separate tables.
